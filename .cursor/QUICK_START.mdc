# Quick Start Guide

## Using the Agent System

### Starting a New Feature

1. **Describe your feature** to the coordinator:
   ```
   @coordinator I want to add user profile editing functionality
   ```

2. **Coordinator will**:
   - Break down the feature into tasks
   - Create an implementation plan
   - Delegate to worker agent

3. **Worker implements** and produces a report

4. **Reviews happen automatically**:
   - Reviewer checks code quality
   - Security checks for vulnerabilities

5. **Coordinator synthesizes** final report

### Reviewing Code

```
@reviewer Review the implementation report for [feature name]
```

### Security Check

```
@security Review [feature/change] for security issues
```

## Agent Roles

| Agent | Purpose | When to Use |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| **Coordinator** | Orchestrates feature development | Starting new features |
| **Worker** | Implements code | Assigned by coordinator |
| **Reviewer** | Code quality review | After implementation |
| **Security** | Security review | After implementation or on request |

## Key Rules

- **Architecture** (`rules/architecture.mdc`): System overview
- **Backend** (`rules/backend.mdc`): Backend coding standards
- **Frontend** (`rules/frontend.mdc`): Frontend coding standards
- **General** (`rules/general.mdc`): Universal coding standards
- **Types** (`rules/types.mdc`): Communication formats

## Skills

Reusable patterns in `skills/`:
- `backend-api-endpoint.mdc`: Creating API endpoints
- `frontend-api-integration.mdc`: Integrating APIs in frontend

## Example Workflow

```
User: "Add dark mode toggle"

Coordinator:
  → Analyzes feature
  → Creates task plan:
     1. Add theme state management
     2. Create toggle component
     3. Persist preference
  → Assigns to Worker

Worker:
  → Implements each task
  → Produces implementation report

Reviewer:
  → Checks code quality
  → Approves or requests changes

Security:
  → Checks for security issues
  → Approves or flags concerns

Coordinator:
  → Synthesizes final report
  → Reports completion
```

## Tips

1. **Be specific** in feature descriptions
2. **Check architecture rules** for system patterns
3. **Follow types.mdc** for consistent reports
4. **Use skills** for common patterns
5. **Review before merging** - always use Reviewer and Security
