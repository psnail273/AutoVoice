# General Guidelines

## Code Quality
- Write clear, readable code with meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose
- Add comments only when the "why" isn't obvious from the code
- Prefer explicit over implicit behavior
- Add docstrings to each function

## Git & Commits
- Write descriptive commit messages
- Keep commits atomic and focused

## Documentation
- Document public APIs and complex logic
- Keep README files up to date when adding new features

## Error Handling
- Handle errors gracefully with meaningful messages
- Log errors appropriately for debugging

## Security
- Always consider security implications when making any change
- Never hardcode secrets, API keys, or credentials - use environment variables
- Sanitize and validate all user input before processing
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Avoid exposing sensitive information in error messages or logs
- Apply principle of least privilege for permissions and access
- Keep dependencies updated to patch known vulnerabilities
- Review code changes for potential security issues before committing
